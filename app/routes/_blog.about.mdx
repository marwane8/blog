## About me

Hello! My name is Marwane Taroua, I am currently a backend engineer at chase in New York.
I have a passion for tech and really figuring out how things work which is what brought me to the field!
I am now on a journey to share what little I know with the world which is why I started this blog. Stay tuned for more :).
