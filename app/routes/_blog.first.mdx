I am trying to share my ideas with the world which is a big step. We will see how this goes inshallah.

## Why Write?

Here is a test for the large caption `sips tea`

> 'To be or not to be.'

### Lets test the basics

Here is the test with the sub caption and some code. We can even test some [links](first) to the same page.

```python
y = dict()
x = 4
```

Here are some exampels of lists!! Now I am going to write a really long line
to test how the text wrapping will look and feel on different screen sizes.
LGTM!
